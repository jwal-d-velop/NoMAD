2025-09-19 - Fixed: macOS 26 menu bar click

- Ensure the NoMAD menu bar icon is clickable on macOS 26 by wiring the
	status item button to an explicit click handler and using popUpMenu(_:).
	This avoids relying on assigning `statusItem.menu`, which on macOS 26
	could prevent click events from reaching the app.
